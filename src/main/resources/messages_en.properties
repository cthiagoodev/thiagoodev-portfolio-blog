# About Section
about.title=About Me
about.p1=They say Brazilians from Cear\u00E1 are born "desenrolados"\u2014natural problem-solvers\u2014and in my case, I transform that resourcefulness into high-performance software. I am a Software Engineer specializing in mobile and backend ecosystems, focusing on high-performance experiences using Flutter and Dart to deliver fluid, native-like UIs. On the backend, I ensure sustainability through the robustness of Java/Kotlin and Spring Boot. In practice, my goal is to bridge interfaces that users love with server architectures built for high availability.
about.p2=My philosophy is rooted in sustainability: clean code is a strategic asset. I prioritize organization and maintainability today to ensure the system can evolve tomorrow without generating unnecessary technical debt.
about.p3=With a track record in high-complexity projects, I have developed everything from scratch\u2014from sales CRMs to platforms used by 60+ legislative chambers and real-time vehicle monitoring systems. If the challenge demands software that "stands its ground" in critical scenarios and real-world scales, I know how to deliver.
about.p4=Outside the code editor, I lead Mobile Devs Cear\u00E1, a tech community dedicated to fostering innovation and knowledge sharing in my region.

community.card.title=Mobile Devs Cear\u00E1
community.text=In 2023, I founded Mobile Devs Cear\u00E1 driven by a simple desire: to connect with other developers who shared the same stack and passion for technology. What started as a personal quest to discuss mobile development and exchange experiences soon gained traction and grew organically.\n\nCurrently, I serve as the lead organizer of this community that unites professionals from across the state. The project, initially focused on Flutter, has evolved into a complete ecosystem for collective learning. Beyond organizing and participating in events, my goal is to foster the use of mobile technologies and contribute to the technical evolution of developers at all levels, strengthening the Cear\u00E1 tech scene through collaboration.
