about.title=About Me
about.p1=They say Brazilians from Cear\u00E1 are born "desenrolados"\u2014natural problem-solvers\u2014and in my case, I transform that resourcefulness into high-performance software. I am a Software Engineer specializing in mobile and backend ecosystems, focusing on high-performance experiences using Flutter and Dart to deliver fluid, native-like UIs. On the backend, I ensure sustainability through the robustness of Java/Kotlin and Spring Boot. In practice, my goal is to bridge interfaces that users love with server architectures built for high availability.
about.p2=My philosophy is rooted in sustainability: clean code is a strategic asset. I prioritize organization and maintainability today to ensure the system can evolve tomorrow without generating unnecessary technical debt.
about.p3=With a track record in high-complexity projects, I have developed everything from scratch\u2014from sales CRMs to platforms used by 60+ legislative chambers and real-time vehicle monitoring systems. If the challenge demands software that "stands its ground" in critical scenarios and real-world scales, I know how to deliver.
about.p4=Outside the code editor, I lead Mobile Devs Cear\u00E1, a tech community dedicated to fostering innovation and knowledge sharing in my region.
